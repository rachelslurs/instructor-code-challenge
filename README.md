## WDI Instructor Code Challenge

### GOAL 

> Create a single page application that will utilize an external API to request movie data. The client side application will be served by a back-end which will have the ability to persist data.

#### If I had more time to work on this...

-Make favorites match the rest of the interface (this is an easy one)
-Currently results are only persistent in terms of stored JSON
-Figure out how to cross reference search results and already favorited movies (perhaps use LocalStorage?)
-Use an MVC to have better data binding support
-Be able to remove favorites

#### Back-end

- This was my first time using Ruby after just doing an hour of CodeAcademy acclimation.
- I need to figure out deployment. Shouldn't be too difficult with Heroku...I hope!
- I should maybe add more explanatory comments

#### Things we are looking for

- Clear, simple code
- Explanatory comments for beginners
- Consistent Naming Conventions
- Valid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

#### Deliverables

- Please send us back a link to a git repo with the completed code challenge. 

- Include a README.md file in your repo with a link to your application deployed on Heroku or Digital Ocean.

#### Bonus

- Rewrite the application using a JavaScript MVC library. Include a readme that explains the benefits and any additional challenges students would face learning the library
